# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis

This repository shares a copy of my SQL querythat I used to analyze two **[datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/rakuten-tv-dramas-and-movies)** reporting COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccination from January 2020 to June 2022. The purpose of the analysis is to report the global numbers . The American website features Asian TV shows and movies from Korea, China, Taiwan, Japan and Thailand translated in over 200 languages. The datasets include 1,800+ titles and 19,000+ credits for actors/actresses and directors.
